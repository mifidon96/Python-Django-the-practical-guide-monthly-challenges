A URL (or route) is an address that sends users to a specific resource online

Views - The logic that is excluded for different URLs
(and Http methods)

Filters - Adjustments or little transformations that we can apply to values
that we're outputting with interpolation

DTL - Django Template Language 

Templates allow us to define HTML documents with dynamic content wherte the content 
is then set dynamically by Django based on data we generate in our views which we 
then pass into our template with the render function for example

We can use filters to adjust the "look" or the formatting of certain values

We use the for tag when repeating conjtent and rendering a list of content based on some date

The if tag renders content conditionally

Template inheritance - a method to add all the elements of an HTML file into 
another without copy-pasting the entire code

to use static files we needed to first:
  load the feature
  Then Django could construct these static paths to include static files such
  as CSS files
